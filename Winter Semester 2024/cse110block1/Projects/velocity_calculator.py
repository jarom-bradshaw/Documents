#Welcome to the velocity calculator. Please enter the following:
#m = mass (in kg)
#g = acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s^2 on Earth, 24 m/s^2 on Jupiter)
#t = time (in seconds)
#p = density of fluid (1.3 kg/m^3 for air, 1000 kg/m^3 for water)
#A = cross sectional area of projectile (in square meters)
#C = drag constant (0.5 for sphere, 1.1 for cylinder falling on itâ€™s side. You could look it up for other shapes.)


#Your inner value of  c = (1 / 2) * p * A * C (round 3 decimal places)

#Your overall velocity is: v(t) = sqrt(mg/c) * (1 - exp((-sqrt(mgc)/m)t))

#     Try determining the velocity for a few different objects that you know. For example, you might try a bowling ball, a loaf of bread, and a skydiver.


#     Compare the difference in velocities for two different gravity values (Earth and Jupiter), assuming everything else is the same.

#     For one of the objects you picked, see if you can determine how long it takes to reach "terminal velocity" which is the fastest that the object will travel, 
#      by entering different values for "t" to see where it stops increasing.

#     Check your guess for the terminal velocity by using Python to compute the terminal velocity, which can be found by determining the velocity v(t) as time t 
#     approaches infinity. This results in the equation for terminal velocity:

#     v_terminal = sqrt(mg/c)
